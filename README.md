###  HoloWriter
Tool for making cool typewriter effect in your games on FPSC/BIM/BIMA engine.

This is a small tool for FPS Creator (by TheGameCreators) users which allows them to **make typewriter effects** for their own games. This looks really cool, despite still being in beta.

## Why?

FPSC is a great engine, but it lacks lots of simple instruments. Thanks to SMan, I've got an idea how to make typewriter effects, but it's too hard to make by bare hands. So I made my own tool.

## How to use it?
Open a tool, write your text, tune **color (necessary in beta)**, some delays or sounds, press a "Generate script" button. Bam! Your script is ready to go! Open an FPSC and assign script to triggerzone marker. When player's visits this zone, your text would appear on a screen in a cool cybernetic typewriter manner!

## TODO list:
- Make default color settings, so user won't pick it each time manually!
- Make a multi-line text.

## Changelog
###### v.0.5b First public beta
- This thing kinda works... sort of.

## How to build?
Use Qt5 and QMake on any Windows (even 7), no additional dependencies or settings. Should work on Linux too (even when I'm not sure why would you try this). 

**Good luck, have fun!**
